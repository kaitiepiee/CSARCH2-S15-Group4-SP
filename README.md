The simulation project assigned to our group was building a decimal-128 floating converter that displays the output for the binary and hexadecimal equivalents. The project was executed through a web-based app using JS, CSS, and HTML. The group successfully applied the principles and concepts learned in CSARCH2 to coding practices, demonstrating proficiency in formulating logic within programming and gaining insights into the constraints inherent in the selected programming languages. Understanding how to implement the converter, rounding methods, and special cases was all a part of the process of building the application. 

The full analysis writeup is found in our repository.

The video for our project DEMO and the # OUTPUT SCREENSHOTS of our program is in a Google Drive Link because the file was too big to upload on Github.
